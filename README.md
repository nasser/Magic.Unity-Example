# Magic.Unity-Example

A sample project demonstrating the [Magic.Unity](https://github.com/nasser/Magic.Unity) integration.

For convenience, it includes the [1.0 release of Magic.Unity](https://github.com/nasser/Magic.Unity/releases/tag/v1.0-beta).

## Notable files

* **`Assets/boids.clj`** The Clojure implementation of [the boids algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids). It is compiled into the `MagicBuild/boids.clj.dll` file and can be recompiled using The procedure described in the [Magic.Unity README](https://github.com/nasser/Magic.Unity/blob/master/README.md).

* **`Assets/Boid.cs`** The Unity component script that is attached to GameObjects in the scene. It looks up and invokes the `boids/update-boid` implemented in `boids.clj`.

* **`Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity`** The scene, combining the Boid comopnent and GameObjects.
